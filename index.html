        <p> 1) We will not provide any support in setting them up. If something doesn't work on your server, tough luck. Any tickets or DMs to staff members will be ignored.
2) Hosting isn't cheap. We reserve the right to make the bots private again should the server be unable to handle the increased load.
3) Bots will not have the random message reply function enabled anywhere but here in OF1D.
4) Any abuse of the bots in your server will result in the bots being removed and your server blacklisted.</p>
